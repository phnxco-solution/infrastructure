# Infrastructure

Shared Docker infrastructure for all apps on a Hostinger VPS (4GB RAM / 2 CPU).

## Stack

- **Traefik v3.6** — reverse proxy, auto-discovers containers via Docker labels
- **MySQL 8.4** — shared database, tuned for 4GB VPS (384M buffer pool, performance_schema OFF)
- **Redis 7 Alpine** — cache, queues, sessions (128mb maxmemory, volatile-lru so no-TTL queue/Horizon/lock keys are never evicted, password-protected)
- **Uptime Kuma** — self-hosted uptime monitoring with Slack/email alerts (runs on same VPS — pair with external monitor like UptimeRobot for VPS-level coverage)
- **Autoheal** — auto-restarts unhealthy containers using Docker healthchecks

No Meilisearch, no Soketi (add when needed).

## Architecture

```
Internet → Cloudflare (DNS+SSL) → VPS:443 → Traefik (traefik-public network)
                                                |
                                    nginx sidecars (per app, Traefik labels)
                                        |
                                    php-fpm / node containers
                                        |
                                    backend network
                                        |
                                  MySQL + Redis
```

Two Docker networks:
- `traefik-public` — Traefik routes to app nginx containers
- `backend` — apps talk to MySQL and Redis

**Firewall:** 80/443 are Cloudflare-only, enforced in two layers — UFW (host) **and** a `DOCKER-USER` rule with a Cloudflare ipset (`scripts/firewall-docker.sh`, persisted by `docker-cloudflare-firewall.service`) because **Docker bypasses UFW**. SSH is on **41922**, key-only, `AllowUsers deploy`.

## Gotchas (provisioning / migration)

- **Ubuntu 22.10+ SSH socket activation**: `ssh.socket` owns the listen port and ignores `sshd_config`'s `Port`. `setup.sh` disables it, enables `ssh.service`, and restarts. **Reboot after `setup.sh`** (new kernel + a stale sshd can linger on 22). Confirm `ssh -p 41922 deploy@ip` in a second terminal before closing root.
- **Root needs `authorized_keys`** before `setup.sh` — it copies root→deploy and `set -e` aborts if root has no key.
- **Docker bypasses UFW**: container-published 80/443 aren't protected by UFW alone. `firewall-docker.sh` (DOCKER-USER + Cloudflare ipset, run on boot by the systemd unit) enforces Cloudflare-only. Verify off-CF: `curl -I http://<ip>/` must time out.
- **GHCR login required on the VPS** (as `deploy`) before pulling private app images, else `compose pull` → `unauthorized`. Docker creds are **per-user** — a `docker compose pull` as `root` fails `denied: denied` even though `deploy` is logged in.
- **Ownership**: `chown -R deploy:deploy /opt/infrastructure` if anything was touched as root. **Never** chown `/opt/volumes` wholesale — container UIDs (`999`) own their data dirs and refuse otherwise.
- **Per-app volume ownership — chown by number, per stack.** Laravel apps run as `www-data` in `php:8.4-fpm-alpine` → `chown -R 82:82`. Node apps end `USER node` → `chown -R 1000:1000` (1000 is `usanzadunje`; **`deploy` is 1001**, so `deploy:deploy` is wrong). Never infer the uid from a username: `docker run --rm <base-image> id www-data`, `docker compose exec -T <svc> id`. Mode 755 owned by the wrong uid lets the container read but not write — the site renders fine while uploads and daily logs silently fail.
- **DNS last**: don't repoint a host until its app container is up on the target VPS, or Traefik returns 404.
- `cron.allow` is `644` (setgid `crontab` must read it); only `deploy` may SSH (`AllowUsers deploy`).
- **DB GUI over SSH** (TablePlus → dockerized MySQL `127.0.0.1:3306`): the SSH hardening sets `AllowTcpForwarding local` — if it's ever `no`, the GUI logs in but the tunnel is refused ("Failed to create tunnel"). The tunnel user is `deploy`; connection type must be **MySQL** (8.4 uses `caching_sha2_password`), not MariaDB.
- Provider-panel firewall (Hostinger) is separate from UFW — must allow 41922/80/443.

## Adding a New App

**Use the `add-app` skill** (`/add-app`, or just ask to add a new app). It detects what
the app actually needs, scaffolds both repos, verifies the stack locally, commits, and
hands back the manual steps and `gh` commands.

`templates/{laravel,nuxt,spa}/` are file **sources** the skill copies and customises —
not a plan. Copying them verbatim is how you get a Node-only frontend stage that can't
build a Wayfinder app, or an image with `public/hot` in it. The `init.sh` scripts that
used to do that were removed for exactly this reason.

Doing it by hand anyway: read `.claude/skills/add-app/references/detect.md` first, and
`env-contract.md` before writing any `.env` — Laravel's defaults are all
production-wrong and every one of them fails silently.

Traefik auto-discovers via labels, so no other infrastructure change is needed. Every
app still needs, and nothing creates for you: the `/opt/volumes/apps/<name>/storage`
skeleton, a MySQL database and user, and `.env` in `apps/<name>/`.

## Docker Networking for App .env

```
DB_HOST=mysql
REDIS_HOST=redis
REDIS_PASSWORD=<from infrastructure .env>
QUEUE_CONNECTION=redis
CACHE_STORE=redis
SESSION_DRIVER=redis
```

## Commands

```bash
# Start infrastructure
cd /opt/infrastructure && docker compose up -d

# Start an app
cd /opt/infrastructure/apps/<name> && docker compose up -d

# Log into GHCR (once per VPS, as deploy) — needed to pull private app images
echo '<ghcr-pat>' | docker login ghcr.io -u <github-user> --password-stdin

# Re-apply / inspect the Docker→Cloudflare firewall
sudo systemctl restart docker-cloudflare-firewall.service
sudo iptables -S DOCKER-USER

# Fix repo ownership after root operations (NEVER chown /opt/volumes)
sudo chown -R deploy:deploy /opt/infrastructure

# View logs
docker compose logs -f <service>

# Encrypted app backup CLI (requires setup; see backups/README.md)
sudo /opt/infrastructure/backups/backup.sh run
sudo /opt/infrastructure/backups/backup.sh list --source drive

# Verify OS hardening
bash /opt/infrastructure/scripts/verify-setup.sh

# Migration: pack data on old VPS
bash /opt/infrastructure/scripts/migrate-pack.sh [--dry-run]

# Migration: restore data on new VPS
bash /opt/infrastructure/scripts/migrate-unpack.sh /path/to/tarball [--verify-only]

# Verify migration
bash /opt/infrastructure/scripts/verify-migration.sh
```

## Debugging / Logs

**App backups:** `backups/README.md` is the operational guide. Run
`backups/install.sh --restore-tested` after configuration and a real restore test to
enable daily 03:00 Europe/Belgrade backups and hourly upload/health systemd timers.
It captures each app online, keeps two complete local sets and every uploaded set
in Drive (year/month/day/run/app). Redis and shared infrastructure are excluded.
Restores stop only the selected app's services/workers and leave them stopped on
partial failure. Never use the whole-VPS migration unpack script for a single-app
rollback. App `.env` may be archived by the runtime on the VPS; never read protected
workspace `.env` files during development/testing. Tests use synthetic data in /tmp.

When something breaks, here's where to look:

| What broke | Where to look | Command |
|------------|---------------|---------|
| **Laravel app** | Docker logs (real-time) | `docker logs <app>-app-1 --tail 100` |
| | Persistent daily logs | `cat /opt/volumes/apps/<name>/storage/logs/laravel-$(date +%Y-%m-%d).log` |
| | Worker/scheduler | Same files — shares mounted storage volume |
| **Nuxt app** | Docker logs (real-time) | `docker logs <app>-app-1 --tail 100` |
| | Persistent daily logs | `cat /opt/volumes/apps/<name>/logs/app-$(date +%Y-%m-%d).log` |
| **Nginx sidecar** | Docker logs | `docker logs <app>-nginx-1 --tail 100` |
| **Traefik** | Docker logs (WARN+ only) | `docker logs traefik --tail 100` |
| **MySQL** | Docker logs | `docker logs mysql --tail 100` |
| | Slow query log | `docker exec mysql cat /var/lib/mysql/slow.log` |
| **Redis** | Docker logs | `docker logs redis --tail 100` |
| **Container restarts** | Autoheal + Docker events | `docker events --filter event=restart --since 1h` |
| **Site 404 / down** | App container not up, GHCR not logged in, or DNS not proxied | `cd /opt/infrastructure/apps/<name> && docker compose ps`; `docker login ghcr.io` |
| **Origin reachable off-Cloudflare** | DOCKER-USER firewall not applied | `sudo systemctl status docker-cloudflare-firewall; sudo iptables -S DOCKER-USER` |

**Log retention:**
- Docker json-file logs: 3 x 10MB (daemon config), lost on container recreation
- Laravel daily logs: 14 days (Laravel default `LOG_DAILY_DAYS`)
- Nuxt daily logs: 14 days (cron cleanup in `scripts/setup.sh`)
- MySQL slow log: rotated weekly (cron in `scripts/setup.sh`)

**Quick searches:**
```bash
# Search Laravel logs for errors today
grep -i error /opt/volumes/apps/<name>/storage/logs/laravel-$(date +%Y-%m-%d).log

# Search Nuxt logs for errors today
grep -i error /opt/volumes/apps/<name>/logs/app-$(date +%Y-%m-%d).log

# Find which container restarted recently
docker ps --filter "status=running" --format "{{.Names}} {{.Status}}" | grep -i restart
```
